<h1>Why did you create this?</h1>
<li>I consider it as additional practice. Coding a problem is trivial when you
do it enough, but be able to properly explain the solution to your audience is
also an important skill since that you'd need as a software developer.</li>
<li>Helps me practice documentation writing skills.</li>
<li>Hopefully it might help someone in the future.</li>


<h1>List of Useful Algorithms</h1>
<p>Below is a list of useful algorithms that I've learned so far. In my opinion,
most of Leetcode is just knowing algorithms and detecting where and when to use
each algorithm. So hopefully this will help you guys get used to Leetcode much faster.
<b> I will update this as I learn more algorithms and have time to do so</b>.

<p><b>Time complexity O(n)</b></p>

<p>
An Algorithm that consists of two pointers that operates on an array or a list.
The two pointers will create a "window" and you will move that window along your
data object, which is usually a list or an array.

<h2>Breadth First Search</h2>
<p>
An Algorithm usually used for tree or graph traversal. For trees, it is useful for 
level-order traversal. Or traversing each node in a particular level before moving onto
a lower level.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
All of the code in this repository may not be from me. Some of these solutions may be my
implementation of other people's algorithm since I'm always looking for new
approach to solving Leetcode problems. It's hard to track what is mine and what is not
so I think it's best to put this here.
